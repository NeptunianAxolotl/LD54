Notes for me to implement a class to handle this:

Ten tracks total, duplicated into two banks (A and B).  Samples are not cut to loop - they are to execute once simultaneously, while the next set are cued on the opposite bank.  Bank cutover is at exactly 28.8 seconds (12 bars * 3 beats per bar * 0.8 seconds per beat at 75 BPM).  Per-track volumes between banks A and B are always identical.

At bank cutover, all ten tracks on the new bank are to start simultaneously.  The samples are all slightly longer so that reverb tails blend together seamlessly.

Track list:
1. High woodwinds (oboe & cor anglais)
2. Bassoons
3. Guitar (Harp)
4. Descant Recorder
5. Alto Recorder
6. Tenor & Bass Recorder
7. Snare Drum
8. Tambourine
9. French Horn
10. Trumpet

The following instruments have SOLOs (they can perform an alternate melody during SOLO phase):
1. High woodwinds (oboe & cor anglais)
4/5. Descant and Alto recorder jointly
9/10. French Horn and Trumpet jointly

Another quasi-solo phase exists called HYMNAL, however ALL instruments play alternate samples during this phase.

Song phase is:
1. RIPIENO (chorus)
2. Either a SOLO (of an instrument whose volume is nonzero) or HYMNAL (if any recorder's volume is nonzero), selected by weighted chance

This loops (so ripieno is played between everything else).

All tracks have an "all-others" track, and possibly a RIPIENO track, a SOLO track and a HYMNAL track.

Priority rules are as follows:
1. During HYMNAL, if the instrument has a HYMNAL track, that plays, otherwise the track does not play.
2. During RIPIENO, if the instrument has a RIPIENO track, that plays, otherwise it plays that instrument's "all-others" track.
3. During SOLO, if it is THIS instrument's solo and this instrument has a SOLO track, that plays, otherwise it plays  that instrument's "all-others" track.
4. During SOLO, if it is NOT this instrument's solo, play that instrument's "all-others" track.
